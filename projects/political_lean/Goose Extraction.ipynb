      "[u' Canada used to be the butt of jokes when it came to economic freedom. A Wall Street Journal article declared the country an \\u201chonorary member of the third world\\u201d in the mid-1990s because of out-of-control debt and spending. But today, Canada\\u2019s economic performance leads the G8, and while fiscal governance has suffered following the 2008 global financial crisis, Canada is not plagued with the seemingly insurmountable problems that face some EU member nations and the United States.\\n\\nIn the early 1990s the federal debt was almost 70 percent of GDP and interest costs to service that out-of-control debt represented almost a third of federal revenue and over a quarter of federal expenditures. The Canada Pension Plan was unsustainable in the face of an aging population. Through the Thatcher/Reagan years, a Progressive Conservative government did little to curb spending and was nearly eliminated from Parliament when the center-left Liberal Party led by Jean Chr\\xe9tien came to power in 1993.\\n\\nWhat changed? Prevailing ideas. As the crisis loomed and debt-rating agencies began reevaluating Canada, the work of think tanks and business leaders that had pushed for sounder fiscal management by Canada\\u2019s government began to pay off. Public opinion swayed, and political battles became moot. Chr\\xe9tien may have been a social democrat, but no party that wanted to stay in power could do so without reforms.\\n\\nBetween 1993 and 2003, Canada\\u2019s federal spending fell every year. The most dramatic changes were enacted through Finance Minister Paul Martin\\u2019s 1995 federal budget, which slashed federal program spending by 9.7 percent (exceeding a target of 8.8 percent in cuts), reducing the number of federal public servants by 14 percent and cutting individual ministries \\xa0as much as 40 percent over two years. These were not cuts to projected growth in spending, but real reductions in the size of government.\\n\\nAll programs, without exception, were subject to \\u201cProgram Review,\\u201d which examined whether the federal government ought to be doing the job each program tried to do, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness with which it did that job. Ministers were required to rate their departments on these criteria: (1) serving the public interest; (2) necessity of government involvement; (3) appropriate federal role; (4) scope for public sector/private sector partnerships; (5) scope for increased efficiency, and; (6) affordability.\\n\\nIn addition to these reforms, control of some programs was decentralized by allocating them to the provinces. Canada\\u2019s federal pension plan was also reformed to be fully funded.\\n\\nThe economy grew as shrinking government freed up room for development, causing revenues to grow and allowing tax cuts, which enabled further economic growth. It was, as the Macdonald-Laurier Institute\\u2019s Brian Lee Crowley declared, \\u201ca delicious virtuous circle.\\u201d\\n\\nCanada is also more welcoming to the world than our southern neighbour. Canada accepts more skilled immigrants each year than the United States, in spite of its much smaller population, and it doesn\\u2019t tie them to specific jobs.\\xa0 No major party opposes immigration.\\n\\nCanada\\u2019s banking system has been rated the world\\u2019s soundest for six years running. It\\u2019s not that regulation is more conservative; it\\u2019s that banks have been allowed to act as they consider most prudent. As in the Great Depression, Canada experienced no bank failures during the recent economic crisis.\\n\\nChallenges remain. Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper\\u2019s Conservative government, the size of the federal public service has grown dramatically, international investment decisions have been blocked, and politically important agricultural trade restrictions continue to be supported. In spite of polls suggesting that the public continued to oppose a budget deficit, the government issued a stimulus package, \\u201cCanada\\u2019s Economic Action Plan,\\u201d which plunged the country back into consecutive deficits that continue to this day. And the provinces have problems of their own.\\n\\nIn spite of the Conservative political brass\\u2019s best efforts to quell small-government advocates\\u2019 accusations of reckless spending, Canadians are unwilling to accept deficits with no plan to balance the budget. Slow and reserved though it may be compared to the reforms of the Chr\\xe9tien Liberals, a steady trudge toward a balanced budget is underway. Canada continues to perform well economically, with some of the lowest welfare expenditures as a percentage of GDP in the developed world, a stable banking system, and, in spite of the growth, a government as a percentage of GDP that\\u2019s comparable to its size in the 1920s.\\n\\nThe battle for restrained government is a battle not of politics but of ideas. Canada\\u2019s past victories give all countries lessons to draw from in the future.\\n\\nThis post is also available in: French, Russian, Vietnamese, Slovak ']\n",

      "[u' Raising the wage will make it more expensive to hire younger and low-skill workers. There are better ways to help the poor.\\n\\nRaising the wage will make it more expensive to hire younger and low-skill workers. There are better ways to help the poor.\\n\\nIn announcing his wrongheaded proposal to increase the minimum wage to $9 an hour, President Obama spoke in lofty terms: \\u201cIn the wealthiest nation on Earth,\\u201d he said in his State of the Union address last month, \\u201cno one who works full time should have to live in poverty.\\u201d\\n\\nIf the debate proceeds as it has \\u2013 many times \\u2013 in the past, then most Democrats will embrace the president\\u2019s message and back the proposal, while most Republicans will oppose it, on the grounds that higher labor costs will lead to higher unemployment.\\n\\nBut we shouldn\\u2019t rely on political opinions in this debate. Facts clearly demonstrate that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea.\\n\\nThe case against raising the minimum wage is straightforward: A higher wage makes it more expensive for firms to hire workers. How big an effect does this have on the job market? Economists debate this. But no one argues that increasing the minimum wage increases the number of unemployed workers who find jobs. In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer.\\n\\nIn announcing his proposal to increase the minimum wage, the president argued that doing so would alleviate poverty. The president is certainly correct to turn his attention to the poor, many of whom have been suffering for years in a tough economy. And it is clearly desirable for households that engage in full-time work not to live in poverty. But increasing the minimum wage would not accomplish this goal.\\n\\nResearch published in 2010 by economists Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser concluded that if the federal minimum wage were increased from $7.25 an hour to $9.50 an hour (remember that the president\\u2019s proposal is to increase the minimum wage to $9 per hour), only 11.3% of workers who would gain from the increase belong to poor households.\\n\\nFirst, many people who live in poverty do not work, and would thus be unaffected by an increase in the minimum wage. In addition, workers who earn the minimum wage are generally not the primary breadwinners in their households. They are secondary earners \\u2013 an elderly parent earning some retirement income or a spouse with a part-time job. Or they are young people living with their parents. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while workers under age 25 make up only about 20% of those who earn hourly wages, they constitute about half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less. Raising the minimum wage is therefore an ineffective anti-poverty proposal.\\n\\nThe case for a higher minimum wage grows even weaker when you stop to consider that there are vastly superior alternatives for steering money to low-income households. For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that expanding the earned income tax credit is a much more efficient way to fight poverty than increasing the minimum wage.\\n\\nWhy have we so often embraced a less effective tool? A tax credit is less politically palatable because it takes money directly out of federal coffers, while the minimum wage can be raised without it showing up directly on the government\\u2019s books. The cost of a higher wage is borne by employers and consumers \\u2013 and by the unfortunate people who end up not working because of it.\\n\\nIt is also important to consider the president\\u2019s proposal to increase the minimum wage in the context of today\\u2019s labor market. The unemployment rate for African American teenagers stands at a staggeringly high 43.1%. For white teenagers, the unemployment rate is 22.1%; a little more than 11% of workers older than 25 and without a high school diploma are unemployed.\\n\\nTo put these numbers in perspective, overall unemployment at the height of the Depression was about 25%. Especially for low-skill workers and for young workers, the two groups of workers who will be disproportionately hit by a minimum-wage increase, ours is a labor market in crisis. Increasing the cost of job creation now is unwise.\\n\\nOne reason public officials continue to embrace such a bad idea is that it\\u2019s popular, and thus can provide an opportunity to score political points. The last time we had this debate, it was President George W. Bush who signed a minimum-wage increase into law. The fact that even a Republican president did so shows just how tempting this policy is to politicians.\\n\\nThe head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Steve Israel, knows this. He told the Washington Post last month that the minimum wage was \\u201ca reminder to suburban independent voters that House Republicans are extreme, and out of touch.\\u201d Rep. Nancy Pelosi seconded that notion, explaining to the Post that Democrats intend to embrace a simple message: \\u201cWe want to raise the minimum wage, and you don\\u2019t. Why not?\\u201d\\n\\nWhy not support increasing the minimum wage? Because it will make it more expensive for businesses to hire young and low-skill workers at a time of crisis-level unemployment. Because it will not alleviate poverty. Because there are much better alternatives to help poor families, and because the minimum wage is a dishonest approach that hides the true cost of the policy.\\n\\nKevin A. Hassett is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, where Michael R. Strain is a research fellow. ']\n",
