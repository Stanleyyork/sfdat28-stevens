# GA Data Science - Project Ideas

### 1. Clare Legere Reading (~11k articles)
- http://www.clarelegere.com/profiles/1
- Data Summary: I use the Instapaper API to pull all the articles I've read over the last 6 years into my own relational DB
- Potential Features:
    - Existing: text (body/title), starred, embedded links, time/day, domain/url, length (words/mins), % read, 
    - Calculated: part of streak, velocity of domain read
- Questions:
    - What are three potential questions you would like to try and answer?
        1. What topics do I read about?
        2. What time/day influences my reading?
        3. What should I recommend to myself to read?
        4. What differentiates the articles I 'star' from the 'non-stars'?
        5. What's the taxonomy of my reading?
        6. What's the sentiment of my reading?
        7. What other people am I similar to?
        8. Do I have balanced reading behavior (politically speaking)? - see #2 below
    - What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
        - See above
    - What do you know about the data so far?
        - See above
    - Why did you choose these topics?
        - I love reading, and tracking myself to further self-awarenes and personal-growth.

### 2. Political Lean (~25k)
- Data Summary: I scrapped allsides.com to get an article link and an associated political lean (5 from left to right) in relational DB
- Questions:
    - What are three potential questions you would like to try and answer?
        1. What are primary differences and commanalities between left and right articles?
        2. Does article X lean left or right?
        3. What article should I read if I want to balance out my political reading?
    - What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
        - See above
    - What do you know about the data so far?
        - See above
    - Why did you choose these topics?
        - I would like to see if I (a) have a balanced reading habit (politically speaking) and (b) if not, suggest content "the other side".
        
### 3. Coach Daily Habits Data (~6k)
- https://www.coach.me/users/2f6f674caa3cf1c240ac/activity
- Data Summary: a app in which you state daily goals and then check them off (e.g. sleep at least 7 hours, read, etc.) in csv or my own no-sql db
- Questions:
    - What are three potential questions you would like to try and answer?
        1. What day am I mostly likely to achieve a habit?
        2. What habit influences another habit?
        3. What habit or habits are mostly likely to allow me to achieve all my habits?
    - What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
        - See above
    - What do you know about the data so far?
        - See above
    - Why did you choose these topics?
        - I'm focused on self-awareness, habits and peronsal-growth.
